Multiple front-end clients sending requests to backend microservice. 
The backend microservice consumes messages from a specific partition in Kafka based on the key provided by the front-end clients. 
Then, the backend microservice sends messages to other microservices, and each microservice sends a reply to the backend microservice.

To read the replies from the specific topics using the key provided by the topic, you can follow these steps:

1. When the front-end clients send requests to the backend microservice, include a unique identifier (such as a request ID or correlation ID) in the message payload or headers.
2. In the backend microservice, when processing the incoming requests, use the unique identifier as the key for producing messages to Kafka topics that other microservices will consume.
3. Ensure that the other microservices use the same unique identifier as the key when producing their replies back to Kafka.
4. In the backend microservice, set up Kafka consumers that subscribe to the corresponding topics where the replies are produced. Configure the consumers to filter and consume messages based on the unique identifier (key) that matches the request they are replying to.
5. When the backend microservice receives replies from the other microservices through Kafka consumers, it can use the unique identifier (key) to associate the reply with the corresponding request.

By using a unique identifier as the key and consistently applying it throughout the message flow, you can correlate requests and their replies effectively.
Keep in mind the following considerations:
- Ensure that the Kafka topics used for communication between microservices have appropriate partitioning and replication configurations to handle the desired level of scalability and fault tolerance.
- Handle scenarios where requests time out or fail to receive replies within a specified time. You can implement mechanisms such as request timeouts or track pending requests to handle such situations.
- Consider error handling and retry mechanisms when processing replies. If a reply is not received or an error occurs, you may need to handle retries or implement appropriate error handling strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can build a reliable and scalable architecture where front-end clients communicate with the backend microservice through Kafka, allowing for efficient request-reply patterns across microservices.
